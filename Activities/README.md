### Activity 1. Painting with Patrick

Students will learn the concept of **Public Key Encryption** by mixing paints together! (Inspired from [this video](https://youtu.be/YEBfamv-_do))

### Activity 2. Tokenize all the things!

A team-building exercise where the concept of **tokens as incentive** are applied to solve a problem. This can be applied to any network or community.

1. Discuss tokenization (10 min).
2. Break into groups to formulate solutions (15 min).
3. Present ideas to the class (10 min).

** Instructions **

Answer the following:
1. What holds value in your network (where is the $$$)?
2. Who are all the participants in your network?
3. What is the problem in your network?
4. Who is not participating, that we could incentivize to participate?
5. Is there value being lost because of non-participation?
6. Can we incentivize the non-participants to prevent the value lost in #5?
7. Draw a simple diagram showing the flow of value (goods, services, $)  between the network.


Potential areas for tokenization include: Cloud Storage, Elections, Journalism, Real Estate, Counterfeit goods, Sovereign Identity
