## Lesson 3 Decentralize Applications (DApps)

#### Using Web3

> WARNING! Don't be a dummy like me and make sure you are using the correct version of web3. Check your package.json file and delete the caret "^" on web3 to prevent automatically updating to a newer version and breaking your DApp.

- Truffle can have its own web3 syntax. Use [these docs](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/overview)
- For `"web3": "0.2x.x"` use [these docs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API) and assign variable directly
- For `"web3": "1.0.0-beta.26"` use [these docs](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3.html) and use `.then()` callback promises

#### Diagnosing issues

- (coming soon) EthStats [explorer](https://ethstats.io/)

#### Security assessment

- Awesome list of [security tools](https://github.com/trailofbits/awesome-ethereum-security)
- Decompiler and Security tool, [Porosity](https://github.com/comaeio/porosity)

#### Wallet integration
